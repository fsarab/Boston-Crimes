# Boston Crime

Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. Records in the new system begin in June of 2015.

## Acknowledgements

The dataset is maintained by Analyze Boston and Boston Police Department - https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system.

## Inspiration

Geospatial clustering of the locations to identify, which area has higher crime rates.
Calculating the trend of the crime across the years and identifying crimes which are more common.
Exploring if variables like Time of the Day, Day of the Week, Weather conditions affect crime rates.


## Method

In this analysis, two main methods including visualization and clustering are adopted. Visualization is an effective method to explore data before we apply any data mining or machine learning methods. It also gives us a quick understanding of our data so that we can investigate the interesting problems later.
Moreover, clustering methods aim at grouping the data based on their characteristics.
In our problem, clusterig method can be used to cluster the neighborhoods of the districts in Boston from our crime data based on their venues that obtained from Foursquare. Crime data also contain different features which are types and numbers of crimes that happened in those districts.
